  deletion semantics across replay, bootstrap, and reconciliation.
- **Decision**: Accepted ADR-0009 for explicit versioned projection mappings,
  strict production schemas, and Mongo-authoritative engine metadata.

  explicit dual-write completion, and differentiated permanent versus
  infrastructure failures.
- **Decision**: Accepted ADR-0011 for at-least-once contiguous Kafka commits,

  draining.

  budgets, scoped failure blocking, and protected DLQ custody.
